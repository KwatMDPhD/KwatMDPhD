## Plan a Communication

Plan what a receiver should know, feel, and do after.

Optimize the channel and the condition for the receiver.

## Communicate

Maximize the message fidelity, which is `signal / noise`.

Slow down.

Use body.

Keep an eye contact.

Say what the receiver wants first.

Structure a message with "What", "So what", and "Now what".

## Interact

Do not interrupt.

State with a question.

Use open-ended questions to explore.

Use close-ended questions to clarify.
