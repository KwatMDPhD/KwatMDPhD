## Greeting

Hello, my name is Kwat.
I'll tell you about my project, Immunogram.

Before I start, I want to ask - who is hungry?
Many of you may have woken up early, drove a long distance, and are ready for the lunch.
In the spirit of lunch, I will go fast, and if you have any super technical questions, please find me later.

Here we go.

## Introduction

Our cohort, and maybe the next ones too, had a difficult time finding a lab during the pandemic.
Many of my pre-existing plans fell out, and I didn't know what to do for my PhD.
During this time, with the introduction from Professor Matthew Porteus, I met with Professor Mark Davis, who taught me that there is no way of measuring the entire immune system and there is a need for it.
And that's how this project started.

Today, there are many immune phenotypes like autoimmunities, infections, and vaccine responses; the immune system is more important than ever.
But there is no one laboratory test that clinicians can order to get a comprehensive state of a patient's immune system.
The complete blood count is probably the closest thing to this global immune metric.
But by itself, it is too general and low-resolution to tell how a person's immune system is doing.
There are also other tests like C-reactive proteins and antibodies.
But they are too general or specific to be used as the ultimate metric for the immune system.

I was surprised.
Given how important the immune system is and given how advanced the biotechnology is today compared to when the CBC was invented, we don't have a test that clinicians can order to comprehensively assess a person's immune system.

This is where the Immunogram comes in, if we can build one of course.
We want it to be what is MRI to joints and ECG to the heart, a framework that is not necessarily perfect but good at giving a comprehensive assessment of a system.
The project is far from complete yet, so I will tell you about what we have so far and our next moves.

##

This is a very open-ended project.
There are probably many ways to make this Immunogram.
But we believe that making something like ECG is the way to go.
ECG, a 100-plus-year-old technology, is an amazing tool in the clinic.
It is generalizable, meaning you can use it to get an insight in heart attack to fitness physiology.
It is interpretable.
Of course you have to learn how to interpret it but once you get a handle, you can use the intuition to see various heart physiologies.
Finally, this is an obvious point, but worth emphasizing - ECG is a clinical bioinformatics tool.
There are too many people trying to create clinical computational tools today, but nearly none can make something as successful as ECG.
We believe that the reason why ECG is successful is because of what I mentioned: generality and interpretability.
It is a measurement framework that measures the electric current at handful of places and using the combination of these readings provide an assessment of a person's heart.
Immunogram should be something like that.
It should measure measure a handful of things that are each super interpretable and combination of them provide rich understanding of the immune system.

##

So, what should we measure in the immune system?
There are multiple immune organs, and the entire system is spread throughout the body.

##

Today, people are paying more attention to their immune system than ever.
Scientists are finding more about how the immune system affects many disorders.
The pandemic has popularized immunology.
People are subscribing to interventions that claim to optimize their immune system.

But how do you know if an intervention like taking a supplement is "boosting" your immune system?
You can't, because there is no metric for the immune system.

There are ways to measure parts of the immune system.
But there is no way to measure the entire system.
My project is build a tool to measure the whole thing, at once.
We call this tool Immunogram.

Immunogram is not a new assay or a new device.
Immunogram is a computational tool that analyzes data from existing assays to summarizes a person's immune system.

There is no metric to measure the human immune system.
There are ways to measure parts of the system.
But there is no way to measure the whole thing.
