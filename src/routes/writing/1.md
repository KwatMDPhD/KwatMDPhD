Are you a graduate student? Post-doc? Or whoever starting to pick up a programming language to analyze your data?

If you pick a wrong language, you will have less options in the future, stuck in academia, and be miserable. I know many colleagues in this position.

But if you watch my video and pick the right one, then companies from biotech to finance will want you, you will have many options, and you can even start a successful tech company.

The back-end languages you should work with are Julia, Rust, and maybe Python and the front-end ones are Java Script and Type Script with Svelte. The languages you must avoid is R and (maybe Python).

I will make a longer video detailing my reasoning including my experience and results if I reach 500 subscribers. So if you want to know more, hit the subscription button. See you in my channel.
